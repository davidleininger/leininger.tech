<article class="content-grid__item">
  <h1>Lists</h1>
  <p>Iâ€™m pretty opinionated. I make lists so I can go back and compare things to the past or remember when something sufficiently blew me away.</p>

  {% set postslist = collections.lists | reverse %}
  {% set listType = "ul" %}
  {% set showTags = false %}
  {% include "postslist.njk" %}
</article>
