      I like to consider myself a professional nerd. My brain is constantly torn between creativity and logic. I love finding examples of good UI and will dev-splain how to fix bad UI to anyone within earshot.

      I am a Staff Software Engineer for Design Systems and Accessibility at <a href="https://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, where I help design and build websites and apps. When I'm not at work, I volunteer with the live streaming at church, and I help run production at several Catholic youth conferences around the country. I live in St. Louis with my amazing wife and <s>daughter</s>{{ ' ' }}
      <s>two</s>{{ ' ' }}
      <s>three daughters</s> four kids. They are all too good for me, but slum it with me because I’m kind of funny, I have power tools, and I'm an average cook.

      I am a diehard Blues fan, LFC fan, and recently became a St Louis City SC fan. I'm a self-proclaimed pizza sommelier, and I could spend hours talking about the merits of pizza. I believe that breakfast food is the best kind of food. I don’t drink coffee, but I love coffee shops. I eat cupcakes by turning them into sandwiches. I like good bourbon. I have a lot of tattoos. I like building things with power tools. I've been to 49 states – here's looking at you Alaska.
